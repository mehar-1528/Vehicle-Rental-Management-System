# Vehicle-Rental-Management-System
## Overview of the problem statement 

Travelling from one place to another is something that everybody does on a daily basis, often multiple times. Many people do not own vehicles, or do not know how to drive. Often, people rent vehicles to travel by themselves to a certain destination or need a driver along. Our application comes in handy to book a vehicle, with or without a driver according to the number of passengers. The booking can be easily done by entering a few details and a vehicle will be provided to them out of the list of vehicles available, and the price is set according to the type of vehicle, source and destination distance and if the customer has opted for a driver or not.
