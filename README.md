# Vehicle-Rental-Management-System
## Overview of the problem statement 

Travelling from one place to another is something that everybody does on a daily basis, often multiple times. Many people do not own vehicles, or do not know how to drive. Often, people rent vehicles to travel by themselves to a certain destination or need a driver along. Our application comes in handy to book a vehicle, with or without a driver according to the number of passengers. The booking can be easily done by entering a few details and a vehicle will be provided to them out of the list of vehicles available, and the price is set according to the type of vehicle, source and destination distance and if the customer has opted for a driver or not. 

## Features of Application
1. Book a vehicle 
  - A customer enters his username and password and opts to book a ride. Once he opts to book a ride, he enters his details and the number of passengers travelling is asked. Based on the number of passengers, the option for the type of the vehicle is displayed. Based on the type of vehicle chosen, the source and the destination distance, the price is mentioned. The amount can be paid via cash or UPI. If the customer decides to book a ride without a driver, the cash option would not be available. If the customer wants to book a vehicle, he has to enter his license number. Only booking of a vehicle without a driver is also not allowed for a minor. The minor has to opt for a driver, otherwise he/she would not be eligible to book a ride. 

2. Book a driver
  - If a customer does not have a license, is a minor or simple decides to not drive, he/she can opt for a driver along with the vehicle. The details of the customers and the number of passengers is asked and based on the number of passengers, the choice for the type of vehicle is displayed. The price of the ride is based on the type of the vehicle chosen, the distance between the source and destination, and extra charges would be added as the customer has opted to ride along with a driver. The driver is allocated is his status is available, so as when he/she is not on the ride with another customer. If the customer has opted to ride along with the driver, he can pay the amount via cash as well as UPI.
